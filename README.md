## Akatsuki Project Global API REST test by the Kodachi team.

These tests are generated with the Postman client program and are intended to test and verify that the API works correctly and that the client can use it safely, easily and without any problems.

## Important notes ###
- The tests must be executed with the authorization of the administrator and all events, problems or actions carried out with the API must be informed.
- The API can only be tested by assistant administrators and some moderators, to avoid unwanted data leakage.

Reporting any important problem is recommended so that it can be corrected by high-ranking administrators and prevent the end customer from being affected by damaging the platform. Please inform all of this to high-ranking administrators or make a "Failure Report" in the API repository.

## Start the API ##
```bash
- $ yarn start: 'With this command the API is initialized locally and without changes in real time.'
- $ yarn start:dev_: 'With this command the API is initialized locally and with changes in real time.'
- $ yarn format: 'With this command the entire API code is formatted to maintain a standard and order in the code.'
```

## Important notes about new Commits. ##
- The commit will not be accepted if it has a corrupt code or the code has a bug that was not corrected.
- The commit will not be accepted if the general file structure of the API is changed.
- The commit will be accepted after being reviewed by the administrators and tested by the same on a local PC before it can be released to the public and added to the master branch.
Any questions, problems or comments, inform the general administrator **"@Sawako__"**.
